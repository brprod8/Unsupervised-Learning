`Unsupervised Learning` *As an advisor in one of the topfive financial advisory firms in the world. Competitors are fierce, so you want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies.* Instead of basing your proposal on only **returns and volatility**, you want to include other factors that might impact the crypto market—leading to better performance for your portfolio. You’ll create a Jupyter notebook that **clusters cryptocurrencies** by their performance in different time periods. *You’ll then plot the results so that you can visually show the performance to the board.*
